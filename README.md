# Donoduck
Simple and free text-to-speech client for live streamers with over 1400 voices ~~that I'm stealing from~~ powered by Uberduck.


-----------------------------


Go to the releases tab, download the latest "Donoduck.zip" from the assets list, and unzip it. You can make a shortcut if you want to put it on your desktop or whatever.

Donors can choose which voice their message will play with by putting "!voicenamehere: " at the beginning of their message.

"Voices.txt" contains the list of voices the program will default to at random if a voice isn't chosen. If the voice file is deleted or moved, the program will automatically generate a new one containing all 1400+ options. The full list of possible voices can be found here or in duckvoices.py:

"Token.txt" is your socket token that will get incoming data from Streamlabs. Get that here:

Once these two files have stuff in then just run the executable let it sit in the background while you stream so that it may scream in the funny voices of your choosing whenever you convince someone to give you money.
