# Donoduck
Simple and free custom text-to-speech client for live streamers with over 1400 voices ~~that I'm stealing from~~ powered by Uberduck.


-----------------------------


Go to the releases tab, download the latest "Donoduck.zip" from the assets list, and unzip it. You can make a shortcut if you want to put it on your desktop or whatever.

Run the executable and let it sit in the background while you stream so that it may scream in the funny voices of your choosing whenever you convince someone to give you money. Tippers can choose which voice their message will play with by putting "!voicenamehere: " at the beginning of their message. (NOTE: If you're having people cheer with bits, have them put the cheer stuff at the end of the message or it will mess this part up)

"Token.txt" is your socket token that will get incoming data from Streamlabs. Get that here:

"Voices.txt" contains the voice(s) the program will default to if a voice isn't chosen (will pick at random if list contains multiple entries). If no voice file exists in the current directory, the program will automatically generate a new one containing all 1400+ options. The full list of possible voices can be found here or in duckvoices.py:
