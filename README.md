# Donoduck
Simple and free text-to-speech client for live streamers powered by Uberduck.


-----------------------------


Go to the releases tab on the right, download the latest "donoduck.zip" from the assets list, and unzip it. You can right click the executable and make a shortcut if you want to put it on your desktop or whatever. Just don't move the executable itself from the folder. Ducks get mad when you take them from their pond.

"Voices.txt" contains the list of voices the program will draw from. Right now it just picks one at random but in the future I'll add some trigger that will let a donor choose the voice if it exists. The full list of possible voices can be found here.

"Token.txt" is your socket token that will get incoming data from Streamlabs. Later this week this will be done in one click with an oauth link but for now you click this link, register an app, and get "Your Socket API Token" from the API Tokens tab. Just make sure it has permissions to access donations.

Once these two files have stuff in then just run the executable let it sit in the background while you stream so that it may scream in the funny voices of your choosing whenever you convince someone to give you money.
